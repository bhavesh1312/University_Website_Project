          <h2>Our Special & Highlighted Features for 2023</h2>
          <p>This year our college provided a free of cost Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning workshop for the students as wells as teachers. A highly skilled working professional from Mitu Skillologies was invited to initiate this workshop program and as a result students as well as teachers could grasp the maximum knowledge he had.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One of the most highlighted feature of this year was "JHANKAR 2K23". This is our annual event, but what makes it special is that it was the first large scale evet after the Covid-19 pandemics.</p>
